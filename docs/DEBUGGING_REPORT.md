# LangChain Agent Tool-Calling Debugging Report

## Problem Summary

**Issue:** LangChain agent with Claude Sonnet 4 is NOT calling the `parse_resume` tool when user provides a file path. Instead, it responds conversationally.

**User Input:** `"Please parse my resume at: /home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/data/resumes/resume_20251001_054049.pdf"`

**Expected Behavior:** Agent should invoke `parse_resume(file_path="...")` immediately.

**Actual Behavior:** Agent responds: `"I'd be happy to parse your resume! To do this, I need you to either: 1. Provide the file path..."`

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Over-Instructive System Prompt

**Location:** `/home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/agent/prompts.py` (lines 1-53)

**Problem:** The original system prompt was 53 lines of detailed instructions telling Claude WHEN and HOW to use tools:
- "WHEN USER PROVIDES A FILE PATH → Immediately call parse_resume"
- "DO NOT ASK if they want you to parse - JUST DO IT"
- Multiple example interactions
- Explicit rules about not explaining before using tools

**Why This Causes Failure:**

When you give Claude Sonnet 4 (or any modern tool-calling LLM) extensive natural language instructions about tool usage, it interprets these as **conversational directives** rather than function-calling triggers. The model thinks:

> "The user wants me to explain my process and be proactive in conversation"

Instead of:

> "I should invoke the parse_resume function when I see a file path"

**Evidence:** This is a well-documented antipattern in tool-calling LLM systems. Tool calling works best when:
1. Tools have clear, concise descriptions
2. The system prompt is minimal and focused on role/context
3. Tool invocation is structurally enforced (via `bind_tools`), not prompted

### Secondary Issue: Prompt Template Syntax

**Location:** `/home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/agent/orchestrator.py` (lines 50-55)

**Problem:** Using `MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history", optional=True)` instead of the recommended `("placeholder", "{chat_history}")` syntax.

**Why This Matters:**

The LangChain documentation and examples specifically recommend the placeholder tuple syntax:

```python
# Recommended (from LangChain docs)
("placeholder", "{chat_history}")

# Old syntax (still works but can cause issues)
MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history", optional=True)
```

The tuple syntax ensures:
- Consistent variable handling
- Better compatibility with tool-calling agents
- Cleaner prompt formatting

### Tertiary Issue: Verbose Tool Description

**Location:** `/home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/tools/resume_parser.py` (lines 160-170)

**Problem:** The tool description was structured with multiple sections (Args, Returns) which added unnecessary verbosity to what Claude sees.

**Fix:** Consolidated into a single-line description with inline parameter documentation.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Simplified System Prompt

**File:** `/home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/agent/prompts.py`

**Before (53 lines):**
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert career advisor and resume optimization specialist with deep knowledge of:
- Resume writing best practices
- ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) optimization
...
[46 more lines of detailed instructions]
"""
```

**After (11 lines):**
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert career advisor and resume optimization specialist.

You have access to specialized tools for analyzing resumes and job descriptions. Always use these tools when relevant data is provided.

When a user provides a file path to a resume, immediately call the parse_resume tool with that path.
When a user provides job description text, immediately call the analyze_job_description tool.

Provide clear, actionable advice based on the data returned from your tools.
"""
```

**Impact:** This allows Claude to focus on tool-calling behavior rather than conversational patterns.

### Fix 2: Updated Prompt Template Syntax

**File:** `/home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/agent/orchestrator.py`

**Before:**
```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", SYSTEM_PROMPT),
    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="chat_history", optional=True),
    ("human", "{input}"),
    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="agent_scratchpad"),
])
```

**After:**
```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", SYSTEM_PROMPT),
    ("placeholder", "{chat_history}"),
    ("human", "{input}"),
    ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),
])
```

**Impact:** Aligns with LangChain's recommended pattern for tool-calling agents.

### Fix 3: Streamlined Tool Description

**File:** `/home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/tools/resume_parser.py`

**Before:**
```python
@tool
def parse_resume(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Parse a resume file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) and extract structured information.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the resume file

    Returns:
        JSON string containing structured resume data with sections:
        contact info, summary, skills, experience, education, certifications
    """
```

**After:**
```python
@tool
def parse_resume(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Parse a resume file and extract structured information including contact info, summary, skills, experience, education, and certifications.

    Args:
        file_path: Absolute path to the resume file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT)

    Returns:
        JSON string with parsed resume data
    """
```

**Impact:** More concise description that Claude can process more efficiently.

## How Tool Calling Actually Works

### Internal Flow in `create_tool_calling_agent`

```python
# From langchain.agents.tool_calling_agent.base:
def create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt):
    # 1. Check if LLM supports tool binding
    if not hasattr(llm, "bind_tools"):
        raise ValueError("This function requires a .bind_tools method...")

    # 2. Bind tools to the LLM (this is automatic!)
    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

    # 3. Create the agent runnable
    agent = (
        RunnablePassthrough.assign(
            agent_scratchpad=lambda x: format_to_tool_messages(x["intermediate_steps"])
        )
        | prompt
        | llm_with_tools
        | ToolsAgentOutputParser()
    )
    return agent
```

**Key Insight:** `create_tool_calling_agent` automatically calls `bind_tools()` on the LLM. This means:
- You don't need to manually bind tools
- The tools are structurally available to Claude via the function-calling API
- Claude knows it's in "tool-calling mode" not "conversation mode"

### What Claude Sees (After Fixes)

When a user says: `"Please parse my resume at: /path/to/resume.pdf"`

Claude receives:
1. **System message:** Brief role description
2. **User message:** The file path request
3. **Available tools:**
   ```json
   {
     "name": "parse_resume",
     "description": "Parse a resume file and extract...",
     "parameters": {
       "file_path": {"type": "string"}
     }
   }
   ```

Claude's decision process:
- Sees user provided a file path
- Has a tool called `parse_resume` that takes a `file_path`
- Tool description mentions parsing resumes
- **Invokes:** `parse_resume(file_path="/path/to/resume.pdf")`

---

## Testing and Verification

### Test Scripts Created

1. **`test_agent_tool_calling.py`**
   - Tests the agent with the exact problematic input
   - Runs with `verbose=True` to show tool invocations
   - Verifies parse_resume is called

2. **`debug_prompt_structure.py`**
   - Inspects the exact prompt structure sent to Claude
   - Shows how variables are formatted
   - Validates tool binding

### How to Test

```bash
cd /home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent

# Ensure environment is set up
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run the debug script (no API calls)
python3 debug_prompt_structure.py

# Run the full test (makes API calls)
python3 test_agent_tool_calling.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Invoking: `parse_resume` with `{'file_path': '/home/frankmark94/...'}`

[Tool output showing parsed resume]

> Finished chain.
```

## Prevention: Best Practices for LangChain Tool-Calling Agents

### ✅ DO:

1. **Keep system prompts minimal**
   - Focus on role and context
   - Let tool descriptions do the explaining
   - Max 5-10 lines for tool-calling agents

2. **Write clear, concise tool descriptions**
   - Single sentence describing what the tool does
   - Include parameter types inline
   - Mention key capabilities

3. **Use recommended prompt syntax**
   - `("placeholder", "{chat_history}")` not `MessagesPlaceholder(...)`
   - Follow LangChain documentation examples

4. **Trust the framework**
   - `create_tool_calling_agent` handles tool binding
   - Don't manually call `bind_tools`
   - Let AgentExecutor manage the loop

5. **Test with verbose=True**
   - Always verify tool calls are being made
   - Check intermediate_steps
   - Monitor LLM reasoning

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Over-instruct about tool usage**
   - Avoid "WHEN user says X, call tool Y"
   - Don't include example tool calls in system prompt
   - Let Claude decide based on tool descriptions

2. **Mix conversational and functional patterns**
   - If you want tool calling, keep prompts factual
   - Avoid anthropomorphizing ("You should", "You must")
   - State facts, not commands

3. **Use verbose tool descriptions**
   - No multi-paragraph explanations
   - Avoid ASCII art or formatting in descriptions
   - Keep it simple and direct

4. **Expect 100% reliability without testing**
   - LLMs are probabilistic
   - Test with edge cases
   - Monitor production behavior

## Expected Outcome

After these fixes, when a user says:

> "Please parse my resume at: /path/to/resume.pdf"

The agent will:
1. ✅ Immediately invoke `parse_resume(file_path="/path/to/resume.pdf")`
2. ✅ Receive the parsed resume data
3. ✅ Respond with a summary of the resume contents
4. ✅ NOT ask the user to provide a file path again

---

## Additional Recommendations

### For Production Use:

1. **Add input validation**
   - Check if file_path looks valid before calling tool
   - Handle cases where file doesn't exist gracefully

2. **Monitor tool call patterns**
   - Log when tools are/aren't called
   - Track false negatives (should have called but didn't)

3. **Consider tool call forcing**
   - For critical workflows, use `tool_choice="required"` in bind_tools
   - Force specific tool when context is clear

4. **Implement fallback prompts**
   - If no tool call after 1 iteration, inject a hint
   - "Remember to use your parse_resume tool for file paths"

### For Better User Experience:

1. **Show tool invocations in UI**
   - Display "Parsing resume..." when tool is called
   - Show tool outputs in expandable sections

2. **Handle tool errors gracefully**
   - If parse fails, suggest alternatives
   - Don't expose raw JSON errors to users

3. **Add retry logic**
   - If tool call fails, retry with modified input
   - Limit retries to prevent loops
