# Debug Summary: Agent Tool Calling Issue

## Problem
The agent was not calling the `parse_resume` tool even when users provided valid file paths. Instead, it responded conversationally without taking action.

## Root Cause
**Passive System Prompt** - The original system prompt was too conversational and didn't explicitly instruct the agent WHEN to use tools.

Original prompt said:
- "You have access to powerful tools..."
- "Typical workflow: 1. Parse the user's resume..."

This gave the agent permission to use tools but didn't **require** it to.

## Diagnosis Steps

### 1. âœ… Verified Tool Registration
- Checked `agent/orchestrator.py` - all 8 tools properly registered
- Tools list includes `parse_resume` at line 39

### 2. âœ… Tested Tool Directly
```bash
python -c "from tools.resume_parser import parse_resume; ..."
```
Result: **Tool works perfectly** - successfully parsed Franklin's resume from DOCX

### 3. âœ… Identified Issue
Agent was ignoring explicit file paths like:
```
"Please parse my resume at: /home/.../resume_20251001_053644.docx"
```

And responding with:
```
"I need you to upload your resume file..."
```

This is a **prompt engineering issue**, not a code bug.

## Solution Implemented

### Modified System Prompt (`agent/prompts.py`)

**Key Changes:**

1. **Added "CRITICAL" Directive**
```
CRITICAL: You MUST use your tools to analyze resumes and jobs.
DO NOT provide advice without first using the appropriate tool.
```

2. **Explicit Tool Usage Rules**
- Listed exactly WHEN to use each tool
- Used bold **ALWAYS** to emphasize requirements
- Added "DO NOT ASK if they want you to parse - JUST DO IT"

3. **Added Example Interactions**
```
User: "Please parse my resume at: /path/to/resume.pdf"
You: [Call parse_resume immediately with that path, then show results]
```

4. **Removed Ambiguity**
- Changed from "You have access to tools"
- To "WHEN USER PROVIDES A FILE PATH â†’ Immediately call parse_resume"

### Updated App Reset Logic (`app.py`)

Added `st.session_state.agent = None` to force agent recreation when starting new conversation.

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Resume Upload
1. Click "ðŸ†• New Conversation" in sidebar (forces prompt reload)
2. Upload a resume file
3. Say: "Please parse my resume at: [file path shown]"
4. **Expected**: Agent immediately calls parse_resume and shows structured data

### Test 2: Direct File Path
1. New conversation
2. Paste: "Parse /home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/data/resumes/resume_20251001_053644.docx"
3. **Expected**: Tool called automatically, no questions asked

### Test 3: Job Analysis
1. With parsed resume
2. Paste a job description
3. **Expected**: Agent calls analyze_job_description automatically

### Test 4: Gap Analysis
1. With both resume and job data
2. Ask: "How well does my resume match?"
3. **Expected**: Agent calls compare_resume_to_job

## Verification

Run this to see parsed resume data:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "
from tools.resume_parser import parse_resume
result = parse_resume.invoke({
    'file_path': '/home/frankmark94/ResumeOptimizationAgent/data/resumes/resume_20251001_053644.docx'
})
print(result[:1000])
"
```

## Files Modified

1. **agent/prompts.py** - Completely rewrote SYSTEM_PROMPT to be more directive
2. **app.py** - Added agent reset on new conversation

## Next Steps for User

1. **Restart Streamlit** (Ctrl+C, then `streamlit run app.py`)
2. **Click "ðŸ†• New Conversation"** to reload the agent with new prompts
3. **Try uploading resume again**
4. **Provide explicit prompts** like:
   - "Parse my resume at: [path]"
   - "Analyze this job: [paste description]"
   - "How well do I match this role?"

## Why This Happened

**LLMs are conversational by default.** Without explicit instructions to take action, Claude (even Sonnet 4) will default to:
- Explaining what it can do
- Asking clarifying questions
- Being helpful but passive

**Solution**: Make prompts **action-oriented** with:
- "ALWAYS do X when Y"
- "Immediately call tool Z"
- "DO NOT ask, just do it"

This is a common pattern in agentic systems - tools must be **prescribed**, not just **available**.

## Related Issues to Monitor

1. If agent still doesn't call tools â†’ Check verbose=True logs in terminal
2. If tools fail â†’ Check file permissions and paths
3. If Claude API errors â†’ Check API key and rate limits

## Success Criteria

âœ… Agent calls parse_resume when given file path
âœ… Agent analyzes jobs when given job text
âœ… Agent compares resume to jobs automatically
âœ… No more "I need you to upload" when path is provided
âœ… Data-driven recommendations instead of generic advice
